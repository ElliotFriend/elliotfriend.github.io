I love joining in with people on any project they may be working on. I
like to find ways that I can be of service to those around me.

I’d love to hear from you if you want:

1. A preacher or public speaker,
1. Someone to consult with regarding your technology needs, or
1. To start something together.

Just drop me a line at **elliot** [at] **voris** [dot] **me**, and I’ll
get back with you soon!
