I'm Elliot. I'm your friend.

I am a Christian, husband, father, preacher, minister, technologist,
skateboarder, reader, writer, lifelong-learner,  and lego-enthusiast.
Most of all, I love to have fun, and spend time with those I care about.

I have an amazing wife, Brandy. Two wonderful children, Journey Sophia
(4) and Boston Elliot (2). My family is super-awesome!
