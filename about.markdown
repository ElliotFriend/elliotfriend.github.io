I'm Elliot. I'm your friend.

I am a Christian, husband, father, preacher, minister, technologist,
skateboarder, reader, writer, and lego-enthusiast. Most of all, I love
to have fun, and spend time with those I care about.

I have an amazing wife, Brandy. Two wonderful children, Journey Sophia (2)
and Boston Elliot (almost 1). My family is, plainly, awesome!
