        <h2>SLCC Website</h2>
        <p>I was a big player in updating the SLCC website. I spear-headed the development and did a lot of the research and groundwork during the process. I helped an A+ team drive this one out of the park! <a href="https://stlchristian.edu">Visit the site and check it out today</a>!</p>

        <h2>Evergreen-ILS</h2>
        <p>McCaslin Library has been a user of Evergreen software for quite some time. As IT Director, maintenance and upkeep of the software falls on me. I try to contribute back whenever I can (most of the time it's documentation). <a href="http://evergreen-ils.org">Learn more about Evergreen here</a>.</p>

        <h2>YNAB &amp; Linux</h2>
        <p>It's not a "project," per se, but I've helped contribute a little bit here and there to the Linux install script for YNAB (which I love) on Linux (which I also love) using WINE. <a href="http://github.com/ElliotFriend/YNABLinuxInstall">Check out my fork here</a>!</p>

        <h2>Submerge</h2>
        <p>SLCC is hosting a conference for High School students in September 2015. In preparation, I've been working on getting a website up and running for providing information, and enabling registration. <a href="https://submergestl.com">Check it out here</a>!</p>
