I totally understand that little girls always fantasize about their dream 
weddings.

Furthermore, I completely understand and expect that Brandy will have
many, many, many hopes and ideas for our wedding.

However, I have almost no expectations, plans, or ideas for this wedding.

As we begin planning our wedding, I'm learning lots of new things. Until
yesterday, I had no idea where this process begins. Brandy and I went to
look at a couple different venues where we could hold the ceremony and
reception. Unfortunately for her, I wasn't the most helpful person that
I could be. To justify myself, I say that I grew up in a house with mostly
boys, and that she's been directly involved in the planning of two weddings
within the past 8 months. But really, I think what it comes down to is
that I haven't put nearly any thought into what I want my wedding to look
like or include.

I'm not at all afraid to offer my opinion on something. If I see something
I don't like, I'm very up-front and honest about it. But, when asked "What
do you want?" I have no response. She felt like I wasn't telling her what
I was really thinking, because I wasn't saying anything. When we were out
looking at different locations yesterday, I started really stressing out
about it. Because she has so much in her mind already, she was expecting
me to at least have some thoughts in my head. Once, we figured out where
we were both coming from, though, things went much smoother. I wasn't
feeling pressured, and she didn't feel like I wasn't being honest.

This whole process is going to be a real learning experience for both of
us, I think. I'm excited to figure out what I want, learn about what she
wants, and most of all prepare for our life together. I'm glad we're
living in a culture where couples plan marriages together. There are going
to be so many opportunities for patience, understanding, and decision-making;
all of which are extremely crucial for a healthy marriage.

While it's going to be a tough road to travel, I'm glad to be on it with
her.
