Each year, we pick our opponent. Each year, we pick the size, weight,
strength, and reach of our heavyweight contender. Each year, we decide
who we'll match up with in our title fight.

This year, I tried to make sure my opponent was simple, easy to understand.

This year, I tried to make my opponent beneficial.

This year, I tried to limit the opponents I would actually decide to take
on.

Here are my opponents for this year, in no particular order:

### Write more consistently ###

I really like to write and put my thoughts down on paper (or on the internet).
Ideally, I'd like to do this on a more regular basis.

### Read my Bible daily ###

This is the discipline that continues to elude me. I feel like this will
be the year that I finally get it down to a habit that I keep.

### Read one book per month ###

I need to read. Not more, period. I really need to feed my brain with
information. I think a book per month is a pretty good pace that I can
achieve/

### Exercise ###

Any amount is a vast improvement.

### Dress like an adult now and then ###

Some days, I want to ditch the jeans and t-shirts that I'm so comfortable
in. I want to get clothes that make me look like an adult, and then wear
them once in a while. I'm a dad now, so why not dress like one?

### Contribute to a community project regularly ###

I'm a big fan of the Open Source community. I'd like to contribute,
financially or otherwise, to some community project frequently.

__The key in my heavyweight bout__: Roll with the punches! If I'm too
dogmatic with any of these, I'm bound to fail. Flexibility will allow me
to fail, get up, dust myself off, and try again.
