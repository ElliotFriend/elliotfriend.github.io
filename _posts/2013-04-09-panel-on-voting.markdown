A while back, I was fortunate enough to participate in a panel discussion
on Third-Party voting, hosted by Dave Glover on 97.1 Talk radio in St.
Louis.

I finally went and downloaded the file to put it up here. The panel is
during the first 15 minutes. Listen, if you want. Heads up: there may be
a curse word here and there.
