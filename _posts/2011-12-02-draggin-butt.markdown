Have you ever had one of those days where you just felt like your feet
were dragging, no matter what you were doing? I'm not talking about just
a little tired, or just feeling a bit off here. Think about being
completely exhausted. Think about being totally stretched past your
limits. This was my day today.

I've had an unbelievably productive week at work. First, I've made some
major headway on our [Evergreen](www.evergreen-ils.org) project at the
college. The server had been down for quite a while, now. I've been able
to get the software up and running, and I've finally had a bit of luck
importing some of our records into the database. Unfortunately, we're not
out of the woods quite yet. This will prove to be a big project for me
for a week or so to go, but I made some giant leaps forward on this
project during the past few days.

Second, I was able to go live with the new online application for the
Admissions team. We've made a couple of improvements to the application,
added a few fields, and made it generally more user-friendly. If you're
a potential college student, check it out, and [apply here](https://stlchristian.edu/admissions/apply)!

Finally, I'm working on a really nifty new service coming for the students
of St. Louis Christian College. A few weeks back, we introduced a piece
of software called [PaperCut](www.papercut.com). It's an all-encompassing
Print Management program that allows the students to print to our new copy
machine easier than they have in the past. This new feature that I'm
working on will allow them to upload directly from their laptop (in .docx,
.xlsx, .pptx, .xls, .pdf, etc. format) to the new copy machine. It'll
print right from their laptop, but still charge their student accounts as
if they were working on one of the library WorkStations. I'm really
excited to roll this out, and I think the students will be, as well.

All of this really just piled up today. I was so dragging all day long.
I felt like I was going to crash and fall asleep standing up in the Library.

Like I said, I feel like I had a greatly productive week! But I'm also
ready to fall asleep tonight and wake up on Sunday!
