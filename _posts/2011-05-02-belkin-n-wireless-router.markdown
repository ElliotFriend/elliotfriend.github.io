We moved!!! We moved across our apartment complex into a 2-bedroom unit!
Now we have a library/office/guest-room. Not only did we upgrade our
living arrangement, but we upgraded our Internet Service, as well. We had
been with At&t, but I made the decision to switch to Charter. I had heard
third-hand horror stories about poor customer service, but the bundle for
basic cable along with&nbsp; internet access about seven times faster for
the same price just must be worth at least trying.

Today, I bought a wireless router to replace the modem-router combo we
had been using with At&t. I had seen an article about the new line of
Belkin wireless routers, and I was impressed. I headed down to
[Micro Center](www.microcenter.com), and was as impressed in real life
as I was on the internet. The N+ was the high-end model, but as far as
buying a router goes, it seems like these purchases will be few and far
between. So, why not splurge just a little bit. This will last a while,
so it will be worth it in the end. Bonus, it also came with my very own
copy of the General Public License (in a lot of different languages)!

Not only is it 802.11n, It's got four Gigabit ethernet ports in the back.
It's perfect for a simple NAS appliance, a network printer, or a home
server. Plus, it's got a USB 2.0 port so that an external hard drive can
be shared across the network. This port can also power an external USB
hub. So, I can hook up several hard drives, flash drives, or whatever
kind of storage that I want!

The instructions could not have been simpler or been easier to follow.
Labeled "1, 2, 3" it would have been pretty hard to mess up. Plug this
into that, put this wire here, power-cycle the modem, and you're off to
the races. The initial set-up was easy peasy lemon squeezy. It was up and
running in a snap. The more impressive part was that there are so many
advanced options. This router has any and every option that you could
want to set up. It's really easy to set up a DMZ, port forwarding,
firewall, and I can even have guest-ready internet access that stays
separate from my private network, so I don't have to give out my WPA2 key
to everybody who wants to check facebook.

The only issues I had were that it took a few power-cycles of the modem.
There were a couple of times that I would change a setting with the router
and the internet connection would kick out. It also didn't seem to play
nice right away with a custom DNS. It was a pain in the butt to get Google
DNS working.

Now that it's all set up, I couldn't be happier with the purchase! This
will definitely be a staple in our technological life for a long time.
