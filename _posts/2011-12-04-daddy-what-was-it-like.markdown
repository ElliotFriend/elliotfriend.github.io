If you're unfamiliar with who I am, or what's going on in my life, you
may not know that my beautiful wife, Brandy, and I are expecting a daughter.
Whoa!! I'm just going to let that sink in for a minute...

I'm going to be a father. God, in all His infinite wisdom, saw fit to trust
my clumsy hands with the life and care of another real-life person ... Why?
What business do I have raising a daughter? What makes me even remotely
ready to do this? I know about computers and Jesus. How does that qualify
me to be a dad?

I feel like it was just yesterday that I was sitting in the dorms at
[St. Louis Christian College](https://stlchristian.edu), acting like a
total dill-hole (ya know, like college kids do). Even still, I find myself
looking back quite fondly on my "college days." I was so free. I didn't
have any responsibilities. I didn't have to provide for anyone. I didn't
have any bills. It was so sweet!

Yet, despite all my questions, despite all the fond memories of my former
days, despite feeling unprepared; I'm more excited than I've ever been in
my life. This is a completely new chapter for me. I've never experienced
anything like what I'm about to go through with this child. We get to
learn together! I can't wait for [Yo Gabba Gabba](www.yogabbagabba.com)
marathons, walks in the park with a stroller, wearing my daughter like a
living front-backpack, and kindergarten musicals!

One chapter ends on our journey of life, and another begins. All we can
do is look forward to the winding road, and give it everything we've got.

What was your reaction when you found out that you were going to be a parent?
